This Project “GSM Based Automatic Room Light Controller with ARDUINO
Microcontroller” is a reliable circuit that takes over the task of controlling the room lights as 
well as counting the number of visitors in the room very accurately. When somebody 
enters the room then the counter is incremented by one and the light in the room will be 
switched ON and when anyone leaves the room then the counter is decremented by one. The 
light will be only switched OFF until all the persons in the room go out.
